## About 
This is a clothing webstore project I made for a three week CTIS 230 class. it consists of two sections of mens and womens clothing and a homepage. The shoppipng cart button is there but the feature was never added to this build. We did not use databases in this class so it has a javascript work around to display all of the information for the pages from JSON files.
